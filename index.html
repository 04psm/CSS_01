			<h2>Devil’s Ivy or pothos (Epipremnum aureum) </h2><br>
			<p>Otherwise known as pothos or golden pothos, devil's ivy is an easy to grow indoor houseplant that will fight off common household toxins. It adds instant colour to any room with cascading tendrils and grows well in water, pots and hanging baskets. The heartleaf philodendron has also been said to be harder to kill than to keep alive! 
			Toxins removed: xylene, benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene.
			</p><br><br>
			<h2>History and etymology</h2><br>
			<p>This species has been assigned to a number of genera. In 1880 when it was first described, it was named Pothos aureus, which is in part why it is often commonly referred to as a "pothos". After a flower was observed in 1962, it was given the new name of Raphidophora aurea. However, after closer examination of the flower, researchers noticed its heightened similarity to Epipremnum pinnatum and synonymised it with that species. Only after further observations of all parts of the plant, including the leaves and growing patterns, was it again separated from E. pinnatum, as E. aureum</p><br><br>
			<h2>Description</h2><br>
			<p>Epipremnum aureum is an evergreen vine growing to 20 m (66 ft) tall, with stems up to 4 cm (2 in) in diameter, climbing by means of aerial roots which adhere to surfaces. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, entire on juvenile plants, but irregularly pinnatifid on mature plants, up to 100 cm (39 in) long and 45 cm (18 in) broad; juvenile leaves are much smaller, typically under 20 cm (8 in) long.
			The flowers are produced in a spathe up to 23 cm (9 in) long. This plant produces trailing stems when it climbs up trees and these take root when they reach the ground and grow along it. The leaves on these trailing stems grow up to 10 cm (4 in) long and are the ones normally seen on this plant when it is cultivated as a potted plant
			</p><br><br>
			<h2>Shy-flowering nature</h2><br>
			<p>While E. aureum is classified as an angiosperm, which typically produce flowers at some point in their life cycle, it is the only reported species in its family (Araceae) that does not develop a flower. Regardless of where this “shy-flowering” plant is grown or what the conditions are like, it will not flower due to a genetic impairment of the gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic gene, EaGA3ox1. This impairment causes the plant to be unable to develop bioactive GAs, which is what is responsible for the flowering of plants via the floral meristem identity gene EaLFY. In E. aureum, the floral meristem identity gene expression is absent due to the lack of GAs from EaGA3ox1. It was found that when GAs were experimentally sprayed onto the plant, flowering was induced</p>

			<h2>Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum) </h2><br>
			<p>Also known as a spathiphyllum, peace lilies are an easy and undemanding plant to look after. Their glossy green leaves make the perfect addition to any room especially those spots with low light. Keep them happy with a weekly water and fertilise with a slow-release fertiliser in spring to promote growth and those glorious white flowers.
			Toxins removed: benzene, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene</p><br><br>
			<p>A long-time favorite of those with a green-thumb and even those without, Spathiphyllum, commonly known as the peace lily, is an adaptable and low-maintenance houseplant. Peace lilies are not true lilies (Lilium spp.) at all, but rather a member of the Araceae family. Its flowers resemble those of the calla lily (both plants belong to the same family) and is the reason for its name. The showy part of the flower features a white, hoodlike sheath (known as a spathe) which resembles a white flag of surrender.</p><br><br>
			There are a wide variety of sizes and types of peace lilies. Most serve as floor plants since they can reach three feet tall and grow wide with big, bold leaves. Mauna loa supreme (a Spathiphyllum hybrid) is the standard midsize type. It grows up to four feet tall and features bronze-green foliage with an abundance of large, cupped spathes.
			It finally got the recognition it deserves from the general public after NASA put it on its list of “Top Ten Household Air Cleaning Plants.” This tropical shade-loving plant helps cleanse the air we breathe.<br><br><p> While we all appreciate cleaner, oxygenated air, it’s also the easy peace lily care, resiliency and forgiving nature that makes them such popular houseplants.</p>

			<h2>Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum) </h2><br>
			<p>Spider plants are the perfect choice for newbies and those with a bad track record when it comes to plants. They thrive in indirect sunlight and survive in just about any condition (they’ve been known to survive in temperatures as low as 2 degrees). Spider plants also send out shoots of baby spider plants called spiderettes. </p><br>
			<p>Toxins removed: formaldehyde and xylene.</p><br>

			<h2>Chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum morifolium)</h2><br>
			<p>Chrysanthemums otherwise known as disbuds or mums are not only a great addition to a floral arrangement but they look great in your home and are known as one of the best air purifiers around. They are among the more difficult air purifiers to grow but the payoff is beautiful colourful blooms. They enjoy good air flow, bright indirect sunlight and watering with warm water only, making sure that they are allowed to dry fully in between drinks.

			Toxins removed: ammonia, benzene, formaldehyde, and xylene<br>

			<h2>Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata v. Bostoniesis)</h2><br>
			<p>This easy-to-grow fern is known for its sword-shaped fronds which makes it perfect for a hanging basket or pedestal. The Boston Fern thrives in humid environments and requires consistent moisture. Keep them happy with regular misting, moist soil and position them in indirect sunlight near windows, balconies and patios. In winter cut the fronds back by around 2-inches to help regenerate and grow in the warmer months.
